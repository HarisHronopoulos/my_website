Being a real adrenaline junkie with a diploma in skydiving, I have hundreds of free falls from 12,000ft and 18,000ft. For those who are interested in trying skydiving, I would suggest to try it at least 4 times before concluding if its a sport that suits you. The first times people get so scared that completely blackout and don't enjoy the process.

You may be wondering how do I have a passion for something that pumps your heartbeat to crazy rates while I also have a passion for something that aims to drop your rates such as meditation. I really can't answer that.
